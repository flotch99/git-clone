# Fletcher's Git Clone

### Aim/Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a git clone in the hopes of achieveing a more detailed understanding of the software. I'll aim to implement functionality in three step method.

#### First Step

The first step in the project will be the ability to create a git, hash an object and decompress it in order to read it. These are equivalent to the three commands git init, git hash-object and git cat-file -p (sha). 

#### Second Step

The second step of the project will be the ability to add a file to be commited, create a tree and the commit itself. This is the same as git add, git write-tree and git commit. 

#### Third Step

The third (but not final) step of the project will be to add a log, show changes and checkout alternate commits. These functionalities are similar to three git commands of git log, git status and git checkout.

#### Additional Steps

Additional functionality may be added following the initial structure building. These could include recreating git branch, git merge and git clone / git push. These additonal functionality may be outside of the scope of a beginners project however I hope to one day have the understanding to add these features.

###### Sidenotes
Whilst building this project is arguably a leap forward for my programming ability I will inevitably become stuck at points. I will attempt to refrain from referencing other users work and generative AI however there may be moments where I need these sources to continue moving forward. In cases where assistance has been used I will make a note of them in the comments of the code.
